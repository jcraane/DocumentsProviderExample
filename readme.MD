Example project implementing an Android DocumentsProvider.

#LocalDocumentsProvider

The LocalDocumentsProvider creates some static files and folders to demonstrate the methods which need to be implemented. See the documentation
in the class itself.

#SimulateNetworkDocumentsProvider

The SimulateNetworkDocumentsProvider simulates calling the network for loading documents.

At the moment switching between the two implementations can be done by enabling the correct implementation in the manifest.
